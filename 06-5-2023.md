## After 1234 seconds, what is the distance of the winning runner?

The winner ran a distance of **3540** meters



## Algorithm

The `distance_after` function takes a `seconds` parameter and returns the distance traveled by the runner after that many seconds of running.

Here is the algorithm for the `distance_after` function:

1. Calculate the duration of a full cycle, which is the sum of the runner's run time and rest time.
2. Divide the `seconds` parameter by the duration of a full cycle to get the number of full cycles completed by the runner.
3. Calculate the distance traveled during full cycles by multiplying the runner's speed by the run time and then by the number of full cycles.
4. Calculate the remaining time by taking the modulus of the `seconds` parameter and the duration of a full cycle.
5. If the remaining time is greater than the runner's run time, add the distance traveled during a full run time to the distance traveled during full cycles.
6. Otherwise, add the distance traveled during the remaining time to the distance traveled during full cycles.
7. Get the total distance traveled in .
8. Compare the total distance travelled by each runner

Question 3: Is the permutation divisible by 7? (1 mark)
Given an integer string, create all integer permutations of its digits. Determine if there is a permutation whose integer value is evenly divisible by 7, i.e. (permutation value) mod 7 = 0.

For example, the possible permutations of 789 are p = {789, 798, 879, 897, 978, 987}. Of these values, p[2] and p[5] is divisible by 7 because 879 mod 7 = 0 and 987 mod 7 = 0.

Their average is (879 + 987) / 2 = 933

What you'll need to do is determine if any of the permutations of 1867 are divisible by 7, and if so, what is the average between the smallest and largest permutation? Decimals are  allowed.

## Answer


The average of the smallest and largest divisible permutations is: 5152


## Algorithm

Steps taken to get thw solution:

1. Define the integer string to be permuted.
2. Generate all permutations of the integer string using the itertools module.
3. Check each permutation for divisibility by `7`, and store the divisible permutations in a list.
4. If there are no divisible permutations, print a message and exit.
5. Compute the average of the smallest and largest divisible permutations.
6. Print the result.

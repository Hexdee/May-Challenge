## What is the average between the smallest and largest permutation?


The average of the smallest and largest divisible permutations is: 5152


## Algorithm

Steps taken to get the solution:

1. Define the integer string to be permuted.
2. Generate all permutations of the integer string using the itertools module.
3. Check each permutation for divisibility by `7`, and store the divisible permutations in a list.
4. If there are no divisible permutations, print a message and exit.
5. Compute the average of the smallest and largest divisible permutations.
6. Print the result.

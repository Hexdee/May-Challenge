# Question

Question 6: How many steps are needed to disconnect the string? (5
marks)

A secure communication network has been compromised and the cyber security team must restore its security. The network, series, is represented as a series of nodes identified using lowercase English letters. The nodes must be disconnected in order to remove the threat. In a single operation, any number of adjacent nodes identified by the same character can be disconnected. Find the minimum number of operations required to disconnect all the nodes and secure the network.

### Example

Suppose we have a series that goes `"aabbaa"`.
To remove the string entirely, you'd first have to get rid of `"bb"` to get `"aaaa"` and then you can remove `"aaaa"`.
You can remove the first `"aa"` to get `"bbaa"` but it means you'd need to spend another two moves to remove `"bb"` and then `"aa"`.
In this case, the minimum number of moves required to delete the entire series is 2.

Another example

Suppose we have another series that goes `"aabbbcccaacccaa"`.

What's the minimum number of moves required for this?

You can remove the middle `"aa"` first to get `"aabbbccccccaa"` and then remove `"cccccc"` to get `"aabbbaa"`, and then you remove the `"bbb"` and subsequently `"aaaa"` to delete the entire series.
Boom, 4 moves.

What is the minimum number of steps required to delete this series ?

## Algorithm

Here's the algorithm for the code:

1. Define the function `find_minimum_deletion` that takes the left index `l`, right index `r`, a dynamic programming array `dp`, and the string `s` as input.
2. If the left index `l` is greater than the right index `r`, return 0 since there are no characters to delete.
3. If the left index `l` is equal to the right index `r`, return 1 since there is only one character, which needs to be deleted.
4. If the value for `dp[l][r]` is already calculated and stored in the dynamic programming array, return the stored value.
5. Initialize the variable `res` to 1 plus the result of recursively calling `find_minimum_deletion` with `l + 1` as the new left index and `r` as the right index. This represents the case when a single character is deleted.
6. Iterate over the range from `l + 1` to `r + 1` with the variable `i`.
   - Check if the characters at positions `l` and `i` in the string `s` are the same.
   - If they are the same, update `res` to the minimum value between `res` and the sum of two recursive calls to `find_minimum_deletion`:
     - The first recursive call with `l + 1` as the new left index and `i - 1` as the new right index. This represents deleting the letters in between the matching characters.
     - The second recursive call with `i` as the new left index and `r` as the right index. This represents deleting the matching character.
7. Store the calculated result `res` in the dynamic programming array `dp` at index `[l][r]` for memoization.
8. Return the final result `res`.
9. In the main section:
   - Initialize the string `s` with the given value.
   - Determine the length of the string `n`.
   - Define the maximum size of the dynamic programming array `N`.
   - Create the dynamic programming array `dp` with size `NxN`, initializing all elements to -1.
   - Call the `find_minimum_deletion` function with initial values of `0` as the left index, `n - 1` as the right index, `dp`, and `s`.
   - Print the result.

This algorithm calculates the minimum number of deletions required to remove consecutive characters in the string `s` following certain rules. The dynamic programming approach optimizes the solution by storing previously calculated results to avoid redundant calculations.

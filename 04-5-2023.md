## Algorithm for the code to determine the floor John ended upon:

Initialize a variable `floor` to 0 to represent the current floor.

Read in the string of instructions from the user.

For each character in the string, do the following:

    If the character is '<', increment the `floor` variable by 1 to represent going up one floor.

b. If the character is '>', decrement the `floor` variable by 1 to represent going down one floor.

After all characters have been processed, print the final value of the `floor` variable.
